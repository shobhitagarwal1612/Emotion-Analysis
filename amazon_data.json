            "review_text": "If you are reading this review, let me tell you that I'm writing this review after using the product since a month.After using the basic lens (18-55mm) with my camera, I wanted to upgrade it with a zoom lens. It it then my search began. I had a budget of 10,000. And within the range of my budget this is the best I could have bought. A great lens if you are in that phase of learning where you want to experiment with new things and reach higher level of photography.Now if you have checked Amazon, a similar zoom lens is priced at 22k. It might make you confused, if you are someone who is new to the world of photography. Well let me note down some points which will clear all your doubts.1. The lens which is 70-300mm but priced at 22k has Auto Focus (AF) and Vibration Reduction (VR) feature which you won't get with this lens. Everything in this lens is Manual. Nothing is Automatic. While capturing you have to manually adjust the settings and focus at your Subject. If you are a learner and your budget is low then go for this lens but if you are rich enough to spend 22k then go for that.P.S. Clicking Picture in the daylight won't make a huge difference but in low lights even a little bit shake can make your image complete blur. Using a Tripod is a better option.2. There is another lens 55-200mm which is available at 10-12k. That lens has AF and VR. But you have to compromise with the zooming power. If you have used a DSLR you surely know the importance of an extra 100mm. So the choice is entirely yours.3. Like Me, if you are someone who want to learn and a bit low on budget then go for this lens. It is worth your bucks. It will enhance your photography skills. Use a tripod while clicking your images, you can give even a 30k lens a good run for its money.Check out the pics that I have clicked using this lens.",

This is a complete manual lens with no VR. Well based on my experience with this lens I would like to clarify all the basic features as well as whom this lens really is for. Sounds good?

I personally use it for bokeh and wildlife shots and nature shots.\u2714 The lens captures fantastic bokeh. This is a super telephoto lens all the way upto 300 mm. Due to high zoom the picture compresses well and blows out the foreground and background of the specific subject. Keep you lens at the maximum aperture an keep the focal length 85 mm or above and you will see some great bokeh which will really make you happy.\u2714 Now I fell in love with the focus ring. The focus ring is really very smooth for easy operating. It focuses very quietly and accurately. If you love manual focusing you subject then this lens will never let you down.\u2714 The lens is and FX lens, so you can use it both with FX as well as DX cameras. Since DX cameras has a 1.5x crop factor therefore the focal length in DX camera would be 105 mm to 450 mm, which is a huge zoom,\u2714 This lens is made of real good glass for the MRP. The lens can shoot with high mega-pixel sensors without ruining the image quality at pixel peep zoom. I saw very less vignetting on this lens which is really good and the pictures are also sharp.\u2714 Considering a super telephoto lens this lens is really light at approx. 425 g which is really spectacular. No clue how Nikon kept those13 lens elements under 500 g.\u2714 Even if it is an FX lens at 7150 bucks but still Nikon has done no compromise with body of the lens. You get that same quality feel for which Nikon is known for, with those pebbles like texture throughout the body.

This is really tough to use this lens without a tripod and the difficulty worsens with increase in focal length. But with practise the problem should go away a bit.\u2718 No Internal Focusing. The lens does not have internal focusing so every time you focus on something the lens barrel moves inwards or outwards thus creating problems in balancing at times.\u2718 The picture is well focused upto 290 mm but at 300 mm the picture becomes soft, I have uploaded a picture of a bird shot at 300 mm, there you can clearly notice that the background is softened.\u2718 Not recommended for those who want to do night photography, because at night the focusing becomes terribly hard even in manual.

To start with, the auto focus is very slow and noisy, and what I have found to be the biggest problem, is that you have to stand quite a long way away from your subject (over 1 metre). If you are on a tight budget and need some zoom this is a good solution. The image quality is excellent up to 200mm; after that, images get slightly soft and there is some loss of contrast; however it is not much of a problem. The end of the lens rotates as it focuses, which is a bit annoying if you are using filters. The lens also does not focus very close, which makes the lens less optimal if you want a cheap macro option. If you plan on shooting outside in good light, It does take very good pictures. For a lens of this price, this could be a good choice for a first zoom lens.",

You should go for VR version...some sample pictures are attached for understanding......",

Though it is manual  but it's got good glass and bad during night time, images become smooth at 300mm and you need a rock hand for going for totally manual.. Overall good lens  ..... Good for bokeh.. Have attached some of the pictures clicked.. But the ring is a bit hard while rolling the lens...",

One should purchase it if he okay with the facts that it don't have in-built automatic focusing as well asVR. So you have to tackle manually.The shake reduction n chromatic aberration (yes it is there) can be removed in post production.Good for Day light portrait, stage shows, sports and to some extent, wildlife photography.Here you can get some examples",

            "review_text": "This lens does not have a motor in it and so it will auto focus on camera bodies with a built in motor e.g D7000 series and FX cameras. On D3000/5000 series you have to manually focus. I own this lens and the images from it on D7000 are surprisingly good. You have to keep shutter speeds greater than 1/focal length if you shoot hand held. On a crop sensor camera its focal length is 105-450mm, so you have to keep shutter speeds of 1/125 to 1/500 sec to avoid camera shake. You may use a tripod to eliminate camera shake. This is a Value for money lens! Congratulations to Nikon for this budget lens. A kit lens + 35mm f/1.8G or 50mm f/1.8 along with this lens is sufficient for most shooting situations. Use a tripod for low light situations. Nikon has created a low budget complete set with 3 or 4 lenses for all of us. Buy it and keep shooting. For the money you paid you will be pleasantly surprised by its image quality.",
