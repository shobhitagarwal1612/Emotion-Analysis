            "review_text": "It's been 2 Years since the Moto E was launched and gone are the days when the Flipkart servers went down due to the extensive searches related to this device. I was provided the device from Rocking Deals.First things first, the device was a Refurbished One. Yes, I did know that when receiving the device. I wanted the device for secondary usage and believe me, this device even though old at Hardware never fails you. Moto E originally ran on Android KitKat and received an eventual update to Lollipop. Although there were restrictions on Storage, RAM and Applications, one could root the device to install Custom Recoveries and Kernels to extend the life of the phone.When I received the Phone, it run CyanogenMod 13 with a September 2016 Nightly based update. It runs an official CM version and you get regular updates which is really great. I use a 16GB Memory Card with adaptable storage to store apps. I can runs most of the apps and games without any hassle which is a really great thing.Note: Device was rooted with an Unlocked Bootloader and Custom TWRP based recovery.There was no official box pack provided with the device. You get a 2AMP Charger which is a Xiaomi one. It charges the device within 90 minutes. The battery life is really awesome for the price. It feels really smooth with daily usage.The reason why I bought this device is to complete my Motorola E experience having used all the previous 1st Gen devices. Since there are no units in the market, this unit is one of the hopeful ways of buying the device. And Rs 2500 is not overpriced. You get a great phone that will easily go for 2 more years with CyanogenMod Updates. Wait no more, grab it while you still can.Hope this helps.",
