VFirstly, I will have to say about the fast and neat delivery of the product in just 2 days of ordering it. Coming to the camera, it is a great beginner level DSLR to have, especially for those who wish to learn and equip themselves with the know and feel of using a DSLR. Great features provided by the camera to take great pictures.

VThe best camera. This is the only camera which have the ability to capture Pro Photography in this price range. Large APSC sensor is very important to get less noisy images. awesome ISO capability , shutter speed is enough. And the video is also clear in resolution and its FPS which is 60! It is the most popular and useful DSLR .

VFirst about amazon experience,Got my 1st DSLR delivered in 4 days after ordering on 8th Aug. Packing was good. And the product was fresh and neat. All the items listed were inside the box. I ordered it from Cloudtail. I was able to register camera and the lens in Nikon website. Warranty card was available in the box without seller stamp. I did not verify from Nikon Service center though reg warranty.About the cam,This is my first DSLR, and i think i did the right thing choosing this 3300.Latest model, good mega pixel (24mp), Good low light performance (less noise), high dynamic range (darker and brighter in same image), great video quality, decent battery. Simply no regrets. I referred many youtube training videos and pdf about photography. I really could not stop using the cam almost every second day just to try out every technique out there, and its really fun throughout. D3300 simply shines in every department.I too checked and very confused between Canon and Nikon.I referred snapsort.com to compare and choose D3300 over 1200D, 600D, 700D. Nothing seems to come in the way of D3300 other than D5200.Between Canon and Nikon, clear difference is builtin auto focus motor in canon which makes lens price cheaper compare to 3300.If one asks me, i would say choose the brand which you would want to permanently get associated to. Cause neither way you are going to miss anything. Generally when upgrading one would stick to same brand. Nikon has everything Canon has with respect to family of lenses/cameras and vice versa. If your 1st DSLR may not be your last go for wither canon or nikon. If it is ur last, then close your eyes and go for D3300.

VFirst time DSLR owner so cannot give you a detailed description. The camera is compact, not bulky compared to other DSLRs I have used. The lenses retract due to a locking system which makes them compact as well. The camera bag is of good quality and fits the camera and both lenses (one lens has to be attached to the cam). I would suggest purchasing a 32GB memory card.

VVery good dslr.. now it's come with advanced Af p lens instead of Af s lens which was bulky. So don get confused when u get the camera it's not packaging fault it's just a new lens. Nothing to review much, go to YouTube and learn the tricksPeople who r in to dslr for first time like me remember the problem behind a bad pic while u start using the cam is not lens or dslr , it's you :)

VBought Nikon DSLR 3300  after making adequate comparative analysis and this camera came  up to my expectations. Amazon offered  the most competitive price.Placed an order for the same. Received the consignment within a week. I will be failing in my duty if I forget  to mention about the exemplary service by Amazon. Hats off to the Amazon team.  Had been to the state of Kerala (Wayanad) _KURUVA ISLAND and BANASURA DAM to test the clarity, precision,sharpness, contrast etc of my Nikon camera, captured a few scenic spots of  Gods Own Country i.e., Kerala. The photos are quite lively. I am not a professional photographer, still I have tried to have some marvellous snaps. I  am uploading a few photographs for the benefit of potential buyers of the camera

VAwesome picture quality. My decision for purchasing this camera is correct after I received this and taken few shots. Another thought was to purchase D5300 but it is not worth spending 10000 more bucks for wifi and 39 focus point system. Both camera has same picture quality if taken correctly..VR2 Lens for 55-200 and 18-55 both are producing crisp clear images. I have attached few of the pics I taken.
