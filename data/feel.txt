VFirstly, I will have to say about the fast and neat delivery of the product in just 2 days of ordering it. Coming to the camera, it is a great beginner level DSLR to have, especially for those who wish to learn and equip themselves with the know and feel of using a DSLR. Great features provided by the camera to take great pictures.

VAfter a lot of research as usual, decided that Nikon India is sheepishly hiding a clearly better product by advertising D5300 and not even mentioning pretty efficiently speced and a bargainishly priced D3300 in their paper advertisements.Except a detachable LCD, wifi and a few more points in Auto focus,I couldn't find any table tilting difference between D3300 and D5300. The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!
