VFirst of all good service from Amazon.in, timely delivery before the expected date. Coming to the product, this is my first DSLR and I have researched online for at least 3 months before getting into a conclusion. It is by far the best among the beginners level DSLR in the 25-45k range. Got confused whether to buy Nikon D3300 or Nikon D5200 but chose this one due to better ISO and faster processor and newer version. I am using this camera since almost 2 months now and after using this I am shocked how can a beginners DSLR give performance like this.Before heading into the review, I would like to mention the contents of the box.\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bfIN THE BOX:\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf\u29bf Nikon D3300 Body, with body cap.\u29bf Nikkor AF-S 18-55 mm f/3.5-5.6 VR II Kit Lens.\u29bf EN-EL14a Li-ion Battery, with a terminal cover.\u29bf MH-24 Battery Charger.\u29bf UC-E17 Data Transfer USB Cable.\u29bf EG-CP14 AV cable.\u29bf Nikon Strap.\u29bf View NX2 CD-ROM.\u29bf User Manual.\u29bf Warranty Card x 2  1.

One year International Warranty Card with the serial number of the lens  [Note: Though the two warranty cards comes with either one of the serial numbers, that does not mean it is only applicable to the lens or  camera only, both the warranty cards are applicable to both camera body and lens. Another thing the other accessories are not covered  under any warranty]\u29bf 8 GB SD Card (Taped outside the box)\u29bf Nikon DSLR Camera Bag\u29bf Two Nikon School CDs and one invitation. (Received it as a offer, may not be applicable in your case)[Note the camera does not come with an Accessory Hot-Shoe Cover, unlike other models, so you have to buy it separately, if you need to protect your hot-shoe, it costs around 35 INR in normal camera shop.]\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714PROS:\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714\u2714 The Sensor: Well o well, the 24 MP sensor that you get in this camera is the same one as that of the Nikon D7100 and Nikon D5300 which speaks much of the picture quality you are going to get with this camera. The sensor has a total pixel density of 24.78 pixels, which result in images having much details, while sacrificing the low light performance a bit.\u2714 The camera comes with a faster and more improved processor, the Expeed 4 Processing Engine which lets the camera to process images and especially videos faster than the older models. This is the main reason why the camera's got faster frame rates than the predecessors.\u2714 The camera does not come with OLPF(Optical Low Pass Filter) which results in significantly sharper images. Nikon is doing a new upgrade in their cameras nowadays i.e, they are removing the Low Pass Filter, so as a result, the camera can now capture both types of light i.e, with shorter wavelength and longer wavelength which ultimately makes the images much more sharper.\u2714 The camera has a 11 point focus system, which is awesome for a camera at this price tag. You get a single cross type focus point in the middle and other 10 normal focus points surrounding the frame. This 11 focus points can do a fast auto focus while paired up with a good lens and it also has 3D tracking functionality. This 11 points are also very helpful and fast responsive during manual focusing.\u2714 The ISO performance is very good for a beginner's DSLR at 12800 and a boost ISO of 25600. More importantly this camera has low noise at 1385 ISO which is awesome. But try to avoid ISO more than 3200 until it is a pitch black scene, because that would produce much noise in the images.\u2714 The battery backup is also great, 700 shots is very much unexpected from a camera of this configuration but Nikon seems to have got it right. The EN-EL14a battery is an upgraded version of the EN-EL14 battery which used to come with the Nikon D3200 and it has increased mAh and efficient power handling.\u2714 The kit lens is very good and it has a much faster auto-focus than the predecessor and is also much compact and lighter. Most importantly the lens comes with VR II motor, which is very useful for a beginner having problems to hold the camera still at earlier stages of photography. It keeps that 52 mm filter thread so no worries for ones who have 52 mm filter from your old lenses, you can use them on this.\u2714 1080p 60fps, now this is a big deal, even some of the advanced DSLRs can't go that far but this does. Very helpful if you need to shoot action. I have been shooting fast action videos with lag free performance at 1080p 60 fps, thanks to the faster new Expeed 4 processor, which has a super fast processing speed.\u2714 You get 5fps 24.0MP RAW files which is awesome but you need a good and faster card for that the offered card can't keep up with that speed. Well a good recommendation and in fact the best card will be SanDisk Extreme Pro, it offers fantastic write speed of 72.8mbps for this camera and the buffer never clicks in if you shoot at burst mode using this card, just you have to keep in mind that the shutter needs to be pressed after every 100 shots to continue burst shooting.\u2714 The camera has a good colour depth of 24.3 bits which produces vivid colours on the images and you can see the effect of those 24.3 bits during post processing.\u2714 The camera comes with a 3 inch 921k dots LCD display, which may not be the best monitor in the world, but certainly it is bright enough and produces vivid colours close to real world view.\u2714 Easy Panaroma mode -  Now it is like a bonus though you hardly need it, but handy at times. Remember you are capturing a panaroma from a DSLR so the picture would be much much better than what you may take with phones.\u2714 Very compact camera. It does not seem like a DSLR if you hold it in your palm, it is so compact and light. The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!

VNikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe "P" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.

VGeneral Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :""" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera..."""So keep learning....

VBought this after months of researches and finally proud to say that this is the best..Its a great camera indeed and best among others even better in comparison with some upper class in range.Although there is huge comparisons between these two giants canon and nikon, both are equally good.its totally your choice.Nikon d3300 seems good to me and I'm great with this.Also its not the gear only but also the photographer who takes the shot,so Believe in yourself...Image quality is great..built quality is great, feels compact in hand, smaller and compact as compare to others in range..600d seems bulky in hand..kit lens is indeed good and can serve nearly all purposes and its the best if you're just starting with photography, although for best quality, opt for dedicated lenses.like prime for portraits, telephoto for wildlife etc..lacks OLPS-Optical Low Pass Filter, which I thought as a disadvantage but it turns out as an advantage as it improves image quality, sharpness.professional level dslr have this feature..battery life is near 700 shots per charge with normal shooting..ISO is pretty high, better low light image quality..speed, performance, features are good..in camera editing and raw processor is great, easy to use functions..modes are good and there is guide mode for super easy shooting, but manual mode is the key to outstanding shots, if mastered..lacks articulating screen and WIFI and stereo sound recording for better sound quality..although best entry level dslr..A must buyand for best quality shoot in RAW..

VReceived 100% genuine product and on time delivery. I got this deal at very affordable price, which saved my lot of money. Thanks to amazon.I would recommend this Nikon D3300 to beginners and Photography lovers. Ultimate product from NIKON. It gives almost all features that of D5300 (Except the inbuilt WiFi and Vari-Angle Monitor). The all new EXPEED 4 processor is awesome to capture and process the image of 6000x4000 resolution and a video of 1920x1080 @60p. Don't think much, Go ahead and get a Nikon D3300. I bet, you will enjoy photography on D3300!

VIt\u2019s odd to think how quickly camera technology can pass from the realm of the pro to the amateur, from cutting-edge to passé. Once upon a time we were all astounded by the 24.5MP resolution of the Nikon D3X, a camera designed for professional photographers who were willing to spend £4200 on their gear. Four years later and some people might reasonably be disappointed that the entry-level £500 Nikon D3300 'only' carries the same 24.2MP resolution as its direct predecessor the D3200. How things change.Despite the identical resolutions of the Nikon D3300 and D3200, there is one very important difference that impacts image quality. For the D3300, Nikon has removed the optical anti-aliasing filter. This is a filter installed in digital cameras to reduce occurrences of optical aberrations such as moiré patterning \u2013 unwanted artifacts appearing on images that feature repetitive detail patterns. While anti-aliasing filters reduce this effect, the cost is a loss in sharpness. Recently it has become a trendy move for camera manufacturers to remove the filters entirely in favour of optimal sharpness, relying on big megapixel counts to cope with any moiré-causing patterns.The effect for a camera like the D3300 is that its high-resolution sensor is now able to capture every possible detail, putting it in the same league with more advanced (and more expensive) cameras. And with that, things get more interesting.NIKON D3300 VS D3200: WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?The resolution may be the same as the D3200, but the D3300 has plenty of other improvements under the bonnet. Chief among these is the new Expeed 4 image-processing engine. Nikon\u2019s fastest processor yet, it improves the D3300\u2019s ISO sensitivity to an impressive maximum of 25,600 and its shooting rate to 5fps \u2013 not top of the league but very impressive for an entry-level camera. There are also a few new automatic flash modes, including an option for fill flash.It\u2019s worth noting that there is plenty that remains the same from the previous model in the series. You\u2019ve got an 11-point AF system, a 3-inch 921k-dot rear screen and a 420 pixel RGB sensor metering system, all things that D3200 users will find thoroughly familiar. The D3300 shoots images in JPEG and 12-bit Raw formats, and is capable of saving them to SD, SDHC or SDXC memory cards.The D3300 also carries one big absence over from its predecessor: built-in Wi-Fi. While Nikon (finally) introduced built-in wi-fi with the D5300, the technology did not carry over to the D3300, which still relies on the separately available WU-1a adapter. It\u2019s not a huge annoyance, just be aware that you\u2019ll have to shell out an extra £40 or so if you want to use Wi-Fi on your D3300.Elsewhere there are a number of other optional extras on the D3300. You can attach the Nikon GP-1 module to a socket on the side of the camera in order to geotag images. There are also a number of additional shooting modes: a Rangefinder Mode (finding which requires a little digging into the menus); Mirror Lock-Up, though only for sensor cleaning, not for shooting; Easy Panorama, which automatically stitches several images together; and Effects Mode, with visual filters such as high-key and Selective Colour.To pair with the D3300, Nikon unveiled a new retractable kit lens, the F-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR II lens, an impressively sharp number with a minimum focus distance of 25cm (when manually focusing; 28cm with AF). As the camera lacks a built-in AF motor it requires AF-S lenses in order to be able to autofocus.

The camera only weighs about 450 g (without the battery), which is super light when you are talking about a DSLR of this performance.\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718CONS:\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718\u2718 The ISO can be used at one full stop, so you can't get the 1/3rd or 1/2nd stop ISO at manual mode, but you get that in auto mode, that is may be something Nikon has not made due to simplicity for beginners, but that is not so great a deal due to good ISO performance of this camera.\u2718 The camera can shoot only 12 bit RAW files, unlike 14 bits in the Nikon D5xxx series, which although produces great image quality, but that extra elegance goes somewhere missing. Though you can hardly notice that until you shoot it at 14 bits RAW and compare the two.\u2718 No articulating screen, this is something that would have been better to have for shooting at tricky situations, but that also would have raised the price. But personally I did not give that much priority. Also in professional DSLRs you hardly get that articulating screen.That said the cons are not that big deal considering the price of this camera and that it is build focusing mostly for the beginners.\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8VERDICT:\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8\u25d8Overall a wonderful camera to be owned. The camera bag offered is also fair enough. Many of us think that camera does the job, if we have good camera we can get good images but that is not the thing, a photographer makes the photograph unique not the camera. Yes, there are some limitations but still that is not that important for good shots. This camera just has more features compared to counterparts from Canon or Sony, or any other company at the same price point but that is not a great deal for photography, this is just a bit advanced. Well I have attached some shots taken with the camera and the camera itself. Thank you for reading this much. I will update the review after more usage in depth. Please hit Yes if you found my review helpful, if not then you can comment on the review with your issue and I will definitely help you. Happy Shopping!!!

VNikon has released a new kit lens in 2016 that is compatible with D3300. There are various kit lenses before it. This is what you need to understand :AF- S 18-55mm VR - oldestAF- S 18-55mm VR II - oldAF- P 18-55mm VR- latestThe "P" stands for a stepping motor, a newer technology which makes the lens significantly quieter (almost silent) and slightly faster. The new lens has also slightly better performance at wide open settings. And it has VR- Vibration Reduction for image stabilization. You can read the Ken Rockwell review of this lens.I've seen many people being angry at the seller for sending them the AF-P VR lens which is the latest, complaining that they did not get the VR II lens. You should be actually thanking them for sending you the latest lens and not the old one.The new Kit lens requires a firmware update for Nikon D3300( V1.01). But the orders placed now and afterwards will receive cameras with the latest firmware inbuilt.About the camera, you know its the best. Splendid image quality equivalent to higher end Nikon DX cameras. So even if you buy the D7200, there wouldn't be a big difference in image quality. The controls n features change.Reasons why you might want to consider Canon 1200D(1300D has no worthy improvement) :1) You want DSLR quality photos. Nikon just does it better. But Canon's still a DSLR with a big sensor. Great photos there too.2) If you don't shoot RAW or if you don't post process your photos, get the Canon. (This is where Nikon's sensor really shines, at getting the fine details back)3) You will get the 2 lens option with Canon under 23K (on good seasons) and that second lens is a  55-250mm IS II. A very good telephoto lens. So if you're not going to buy another lens at all, Canon has a better deal.4) Canon lenses are usually cheaper. Like the 50mm f1.8 portrait lens. Nikon cost 10,000 INR while Canon's variant is around or below 8000 INR.5)Canon has a very cheap wide lens, the 10-18mm. Nikon doesn't !Canon Cons :1) No amazing sensor. Canon's sensor is smaller in size too. Hence less efficient. But still capable of DSLR quality images. Nikon takes better shots under low light.2) Not for video lovers. No mic jack on Canon. Does not do 60fps which is required for slow mo. Nikon has a mic jack for clear external audio and it does 60fps too.3) Nikon is smaller and lighter.4) Battery. Nikon has double the battery capability compared to Canon.Both have no touch screen nor a screen that tilts. The Kit lens that comes with Nikon is significantly better than Canon's. So it takes great pictures. Sample shots can be seen at Pixelpeeper or Flickr.And yes, the kits lens can blur the background at 55mm f5.6.Lenses to buy afterwards, if you're serious about photography :1) Nikon AF P 70-300 VR. Stabilized lens for 14-15k is a great deal. Autofocus is really fast but the aperture at 300mm is 6.3. So it would struggle a bit under low light situations. A major wildlife photographer needs something like the Tamron 150-600mm lens.2) Nikon 35mm f1.8G. An all around amazing lens. This lens makes you a better photographer. Fixed prime, meaning no zoom. But unmatched image quality at this price. Great for indoor shots too.3) A wide angle lens. Expensive Tokina 11-16mm.4) If portraits are a big deal to you, only then go for the 50mm f1.8 G.Overall an amazing camera. You cannot go wrong with this one. Just make sure you really need a DSLR and its features. If you're someone who needs better images than smartphones with a good flash, better portability and going to shoot in Auto Mode anyway, you're looking for a point and shoot camera and the new ones takes great pictures under good light.

VAfter a lot of research as usual, decided that Nikon India is sheepishly hiding a clearly better product by advertising D5300 and not even mentioning pretty efficiently speced and a bargainishly priced D3300 in their paper advertisements.Except a detachable LCD, wifi and a few more points in Auto focus,I couldn't find any table tilting difference between D3300 and D5300. The sensor is the same, the mega pixel count is the same. Heck D3300 doesn't even have a light filter making each pixel square accept more light. This is advanced DSLR category!I got it at a fantastic price on Amazon. Opted for next day delivery. No probs at all.Went to a 40 day trip to Canada, captured more than 7000 pictures. The images are crisp, color tones perfect, out of the box 'Auto Mode' captures pretty decent (at times even better than manual!) images. Low light performance is also acceptable. Though one needs a bit more practice at low shttee speeds and without a tripod. If you plan to explore night life with this serious camera, you'd definately need a tripod. Otherwise no complains at all. Already feel like I have got my investment's return!I also captured tons of Full HD videos. God the only thing I missed is the image stabilization coz on a 42" 3D tv the lack of motion soothing is heavily missed. Yet when you know what you're doing, D3300 takes mind boggling videos!The lens along with the kit is the ED VR 18-55 mm Nikkor lens. It does the job perfectly for your day to day photography. But I am just so sure looking at the specs that the D3300 has tons more to offer so planing to by a Prime lens and also a zoom/macro lens in the near future.The party has only just started!

VGeneral Observations about Amazon, packaging & warrantyProduct ordered on 15th Oct --- Delivered on 29th Oct....!!!Packaging was very good.No dealer stamp on warranty and Bill doesnt contain product number which may be a problem for warranty, have to clarify with amazon regarding this, Before purchase i asked them about warranty and they have assured if u buy from Amazon fulfilled supplier amazon will give warranty even if nikon does not gives thats when i decided to buy online since it was 6k cheaper than authorized dealers which will save u money to buy an extra lens!!!Now about the Nikon masterpiece D3300Before buying any expensive product online it is mandatory for us all to do a research about the competetion and available products within our budget. Please compare the available products in ur price range only like u can not compare D3300 with a DSLR costing 55K...It will come down to Canon 1200D with zoom lens kit, D3200, D5200 and Canon 600D.All between 26-32k range. Nikon D3100 & Canon 1100D etc are old models and are still cheaper so i didnt considered them.Being a first DSLR hands down almost 99% of google recommemds D3300. I went to Nikon and Canon dealers and checked all models in this budget. heres why i went for D3300 & the after experience :1) It offers u latest processor and sensor with VR-II kit lens.2) The Battery Life is Best in its class with remarkable nos ahead from the competetion and i felt the same after using it.3) Its really very handy and small compared to D5200, only thing 5200 has a tilt screen but i felt it will not make that much difference, for fitting a tilt screen the size of the camera becomes large. I read a lot since my final two models were 5200 and 3300 and felt that the latest processor and better battery life and a diff of 6k for D3300 will be good for my requirements. Since nowhere u can find exceptional difference between image quality of the two cameras. HDR u will hardly require and tilt screen for me was not a priority.4) The image quality is superb. it has a child mode which is very useful when u dont have time for manual settings. Auto mode produces fine images when u dont have time for settings.5) Comes with 8GB card which will be sufficient for few months till u conquer all skills of photography.6) Bag is ok but not very stylish. Can accomodate an extra lens easily.7) Camera is very very fast, first time users will fall in love with the speed of the camera absolutely no lags anywhere.8) Photograps in low light and indoor pics at evening or night time are also very impressive. Flash does an excellent job.9) Colour reproduction is superb, if u click vegetables and look on HDTV they look way better than they look in real life :)...10) I was not used to click pics through view finder so i thought live view is a very useful feature for a DSLR but in real life u will  hardly use live view once u get ur hands on unless a position where u cant put ur head below the cam, even with specks it is  very easy to shoot using view finder .11) LCD screen is very good. With high resolution screen u can judge the quality of image immediatly after clicking which is difficult if  the LCD resolution is low.12) Nikon website is very informative and helps a lot u can register for nikon school and refer tutorials.13) Canon 1200D with Kit lens & zoom lens is a very tough competetion since Nikon D3300 with similar zoom lens is 10K more but  after a lot of reading from websites and reviews u will find that for image quality nikon is a clear winner at entry level DSLR by a  far margin. Kit lens will fulfil most of ur photography requirements initially, wait till u discover urself what lens u really require  before going on to purchase the combo pack with zoom lens.  Hence i decided to buy D3300 and leave the zoom lens in to be bought further category.14) It takes a little time for autofocus at night in very low light but it is ok otherwise autofocus in all other conditions is excellent.  captures fast moving objects in the frame perfectly.15) Manual supplied in the box is useful, and should be read first if u r using a DSLR for the first time.16) It has a wifi feature which may b useful for clicking pics using ur smart phone but requires u to purchase a dongle.It feels excellent to click from this cam because of its fine ergonomics, small size and light weight. its a worth investment. Its a long road in learning and mastering the techniques in photography, with nikon u will enjoy learing it coz when u do it right it delivers excellent results.... just remember a quote which i like very much :""" Buying a Nikon doesnt makes u a photographer... it only makes u the owner of the Nikon Camera..."""So keep learning....

VBought this after months of researches and finally proud to say that this is the best..Its a great camera indeed and best among others even better in comparison with some upper class in range.Although there is huge comparisons between these two giants canon and nikon, both are equally good.its totally your choice.Nikon d3300 seems good to me and I'm great with this.Also its not the gear only but also the photographer who takes the shot,so Believe in yourself...Image quality is great..built quality is great, feels compact in hand, smaller and compact as compare to others in range..600d seems bulky in hand..kit lens is indeed good and can serve nearly all purposes and its the best if you're just starting with photography, although for best quality, opt for dedicated lenses.like prime for portraits, telephoto for wildlife etc..lacks OLPS-Optical Low Pass Filter, which I thought as a disadvantage but it turns out as an advantage as it improves image quality, sharpness.professional level dslr have this feature..battery life is near 700 shots per charge with normal shooting..ISO is pretty high, better low light image quality..speed, performance, features are good..in camera editing and raw processor is great, easy to use functions..modes are good and there is guide mode for super easy shooting, but manual mode is the key to outstanding shots, if mastered..lacks articulating screen and WIFI and stereo sound recording for better sound quality..although best entry level dslr..A must buyand for best quality shoot in RAW..

VThe D3200's most exciting new feature is clearly the new 24-megapixel image sensor, which is partly responsible for the camera's strong improvement in sharpness over the D3100. Sadly, when it comes to image quality, the excitement ends there.pros :CompactGood quality at high ISOsGuide Mode for beginnersContinuous video autofocusMic inputEasy to usePerforms well and delivers great imagescons :Small pentamirror viewfinderFixed LCDKit lens could be betterPerhaps 24 megapixels might be overkill for entry-level usersNo auto exposure bracketing or optical depth-of-field previewComplicated menu systemUnderused command dialNo built-in AF motor so can't auto-focus with non AF-S lensesNo live histogramSlight blue cast on LCD display in some lighting conditionsRelatively high price

VIt's a best buy in this range. image quality, battery back-up, easy to handle. 18-55mm lens works fine if you are just a normal user. I would say go for this even if this is your first DSLR. It's a best one and you can learn more.

VUndoubtedly this is the best camera in Entry-Level DSLRs. First of all thanks to NIKON for providing excellent image quality and noise reduction, one can obtain absolutely noise free images even at 1600 ISO (1385 being the exact value). Its light weight and small body makes it easy to carry on longer trips and the Battery life of 700 shots serves as an extra perk.Secondly Thanks to AMAZON for providing this camera at an amazing price of 26,400 and Super fast 1 Day delivery. The product was properly packed and also consisted of a good quality DSLR bag and a 8GB card along with the camera package.5stars to the combo.

VAll my first dslr research ends here.Guys before buying this cam ,I searched a lot so this review can save a lot of your time and confusions.First thing,for all those who are scared of buying slr online: Yes,your fear is right but not with trusted sellers on Amazon.Nikon clearly says they will not cover warranty for products sold online from some E-commerce sites ,even i got scared but I did complete research on this.I got this camera from a seller CloudTail . Guys if you google you will find he is the biggest seller on Amazon India or you can say amazon India mostly belongs to him.2.Then i carefully checked amazon policies regarding returns.They even pay the money back in case of faulty products where orders are Amazon fulfilled so toattly relax there.3.I checked this cam from Nikon office in Gurgaon.They confirmed he is their authorized seller and the product is totally genuine and also I was able to register it on Nikon.Guys please beware that registration does not mean covered in warranty.Please keep the warranty cards and bill with you to seek warranty if required.Now yes review of the camera: Those who are confused between NikonD3200 or Nikon D5100.Just dont go for D5100 now.Its an oldie now (older processor,slow speed) ,if you say tilt screen,I must say if you think this an advantage ,please dont buy an slr go for point and shoot.If you really like to do photography ,tilt screen is no use at all.You may go for Nikon D3200 is you have a price constraint as most of the features are similar.I have used bot and also talked to nikon expert he simply asked me to go for Nikon D3300 because its the latest one ,has a new processor ,has better image quality.and trust me guys its true.This cam feels a mid level slr.is fast ,superb image quality,Kit lens is good but I would recommed a 35mm prime coz its awsm.I wish you best of luck and happy Buying from Amazon.

But for those new to DSLR photography, Nikon did a great job of including automatic, easy to use features with this camera too.One feature aimed at those new to DSLR photography is the Nikon D3300\u2019s Guide mode. The Guide explains the camera\u2019s features on the screen as you activate them, and it even can help you make changes to the D3300\u2019s settings when you want to perform certain tasks. This type of on-screen help mode simply isn\u2019t found on advanced cameras or other DSLR cameras, which makes the D3300 a great camera for inexperienced photographers, either those new to digital photography or those new to DSLR photography.As with most DSLR cameras, you can shoot in two modes with the D3300 \u2014 Live View and viewfinder modes. This Nikon model works fast when you\u2019re in viewfinder mode, providing minimal shutter lag and shot to shot delays. But if you switch to Live View mode, where you frame the scene using the LCD screen like you would with one of the best point and shoot cameras, the shutter lag can be 1 second or more. Be prepared to be ticked off occasionally over this camera\u2019s sluggishness in Live View mode when you miss a photo because of shutter lag or long shot to shot delays.The D3300 also only offers an 11-point autofocus system, which ranks behind most other DSLR cameras and explains some of this camera\u2019s slow performance in Live View mode.When considering DSLR cameras, be sure to look at the Nikon D3300 against a Nikon D5300, where you\u2019ll find the D5300 has a higher price point by almost $200. And the Nikon D3300 vs. D5300 comparison also shows that the D5300 has some desirable features, including a tiltable LCD screen and built-in WiFi. One way Nikon keeps the D3300 DSLR at a lower price point is by not offering those features.IMAGE QUALITYNikon designed the D3300 DSLR around an APS-C image sensor with 24.2 megapixels of resolution, which results in very good image quality. The D3300\u2019s image quality surpasses most of the models you\u2019ll find in this price range.Another feature of this model that leads to great image quality is that Nikon removed the anti-aliasing filter from the image sensor. Although you run the risk of seeing a moire pattern without an anti-aliasing filter, this is a rare problem with modern image sensors. So manufacturers are removing this filter more often to allow for sharper images, and it works well with the D3300.When comparing the D3300 to a Nikon D5500 review, you\u2019ll see both cameras have almost an identical image sensor, both in terms of physical size and in the number of megapixels of resolution, allowing the image quality of the two cameras to remain somewhat similar. But the D5500\u2019s price point is nearly double that of the D3300, because it contains a host of extra features, such as a touchscreen LCD and a tilting LCD.LOW LIGHT PERFORMANCE AND MOVIE MODENikon D3300 DSLR reviewPlenty of control buttons allow you to easily make changes to the D3300\u2019s settings.Against comparable cameras, the Nikon D3300 DSLR works very well in low light photography situations. Incorrect pixels (called noise) are minimal in dark scenes, whether you choose to use the D3300\u2019s popup flash unit or to increase the ISO setting close to the camera\u2019s maximum native setting of 12800. (An extended ISO setting of 25600 is available too, but it does provide quite a bit of noise.) You also can add an external flash to the camera\u2019s hot shoe.With full-time autofocus, the D3300\u2019s movie recording capabilities are stronger than other entry-level DSLRs. You\u2019ll have access to full HD recording with the Nikon D3300 at up to 60 frames per second, which is above average performance against similarly priced models.BATTERY LIFEBattery life is one area where the D3300 easily wins a Nikon D3300 vs. Canon T5i comparison. Nikon estimates that the D3300 can record up to 700 photos per battery charge, whereas the T5i is rated for up to 440 shots per charge.Keep in mind that those battery life estimates are primarily for using these DSLR cameras in viewfinder mode and not Live View mode. Testing shows that using Live View mode causes the battery life to be about half for the D3300 of what you\u2019ll receive by using the camera primarily in viewfinder mode.WRAP UPDSLR cameras can be expensive, especially when you add in the costs of extra gear beyond the camera body, such as lenses and flash units. So if you need a versatile DSLR camera at a low price point, the Nikon D3300 DSLR is a great option. It provides 24.2 megapixels of resolution and very good image quality, which is great to find in a DSLR camera under $500. When matching this model against its predecessor, the Nikon D3300 vs. D3200 comparison shows the D3300 has longer battery life and better low light image quality, both of which are desirable features. The D3300 has a good form factor and a slightly lighter camera body than the D3200 too, meaning those who own the older camera may find that an upgrade to the D3300 \u2014 which made our best DSLR cameras list \u2014 is a smart idea.

VI purchased this camera for the purpose of having a great travel camera, and a "go to" camera when I don't feel like lugging along a lot of equipment. The image quality is superb. Where the D3300 really excels over the 3100 & 3200 is the ISO range. It takes beautiful shots in lower natural lighting situations, but realize that the lens has something to do with this as well. There were some complaints about the camera, but again, I believe this to be due to the limitations of the included kit lens (which has a limited range of aperture & depth of field). The settings on the camera can only go so far as the lens allows. It would be best to match your lens with the type(s) of photography you like to do rather than expecting the camera to work like a point and shoot. As far as the image processing and video the camera performs very well. Nikon D3300 is very easy to use, and would be a perfect entry level camera for the anyone not familiar with DSLRs. There are tons of features with this camera, and some interesting modes for certain effects that are quite simply fun & easy for anyone to use. If you'd like the ease of a point and shoot camera yet want much more professional looking and beautiful images, this is the camera for you. Realize that you may need lenses (prime, longer range zoom, or macro) to get the most from this camera, that's up to you in choosing what matches your needs. Personally, I'd purchase it again in a heartbeat, and am looking forward to using it during my travels and the holidays. I'm very pleased. Highly recommended!

VReally awesome dslr. Much better than the canon 1200d though there is significant price difference, i would still recommend to go for this as i have seen both the dslr and quite frankly i like this one much better. Only one drawback according  to me is the confusing manual mode it takes time get to know how to change the settings. But the overall image quality is excellent. And the night photography is also great.

VIn the beginning i was bit puzzled between D5300 & D3300 but after doing some thorough research i decided to buy D3300 & it was worth every penny spent! The image quality is sharp and fine & it is an Excellent DSLR entry level camera from Nikon.Regarding Product - It was a sealed package having Nikon seal and signs of tampering were not there. This product comes with free SanDisk 8GB Class10 SDHC Card and a Nikon DSLR Bag. Overall satisfied but the packaging and delivery by the Amazon could have been better. I haven't read through the entire booklet but will surely read it. I will recommend this DSLR to everyone who is tight on budget and is beginning his/her photography journey.
