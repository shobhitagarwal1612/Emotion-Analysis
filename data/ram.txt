VGreat at price ..wish ram will be 2 gb..for better performanceExcellent battery life..design and model is reach to carry..Budgeted phone..with power packed features except RAM..charger is too small..delicate to carry..5.5 inch..makes it uncomfortable...but sleak body add support in it

Vthis is just a huge company tag phone with absolutely no price worthy featuresyou can get a lot more phones in this price segment that offers you higher specs then this phonebut if you want a branded phone i gruaatany you that you can not get a better phone then thisyeah you can get redmi note 3 but again if company doesnot matterprons1 you get a branded phone2 s bike mobe is the best for a bike rider3 1.5 gb ram would be enough for most of u4 the processor is not the best but also not the worstcons1 the 1.5 gb ram would not be enough for some users2 the camera is not price worthy3 not suitable for low light photography4 the size of phone is also very big
