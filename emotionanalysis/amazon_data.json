            "review_text": "Bought this recently, The product seems fine however it is NOT a snug fit on the DSLR hotshoe and the screw above the base plate doesn't go all the way down to lock on the hotshoe as well, when I try to pull it out it comes out easily, although when I tilted the camera it did not fall out of the hotshoe which is a small consolation, however this was without anything attached to it, tried with Gopro on it with the tripod mount didn't feel much confidence even with the weight.. Nevertheless this one needs improvement so that it fits the hotshoe well. As of now a jugaad will be to put in a piece of paper below the base on the hotshoe and then mount this, then it could become tight and don't come out of the slot easily, I haven't tried but just an idea.",

Packing need to be taking care becoz the tip of screw pole almost teard up the wrapped cover...And about the product -- it's not tight enough when placed in camera mount shoe even thouht i tried to screw down becoz of its limited screwing path... Screwing path on the pole should curve till the bottom so that it could screw down more and make more tighten.",
