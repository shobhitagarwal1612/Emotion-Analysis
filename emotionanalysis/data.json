                "review_text": "Cons : 1) If you have used the OnePlus one, then you know that this isn't the sandstone finish right away. At best, it feels like a fraction of the original sandstone finish. 2) The sandstone finish is not just on the outside, but on the inside too. There is a potential for severe scratch if not applied/removed with the utmost care. 3) It is a nightmare to remove and/or apply this case. Even the button protection has the sandstone finish on the inside which makes me very nervous while pressing the buttons from over the case. 4) Lacks OnePlus logo (as expected), but has a very subtle print which says \"Tapfond\". Pros: 1) Really lightweight and increased grip than what the metal body can offer. 2) Best hard cover in this price segment. 3) Covers phone from all 4 sides and the back while covering the camera hump. Verdict : Better buy the original OnePlus sandstone cover for 800 if possible. It's the best. If you're tight on budget and want a sandtone(ish) case, get this but don't keep removing/applying this case continuously to avoid scratches.",

One plus has switched to aluminum I missed the sand stone back but this case makes up for it but the texture is decent but the case covers the phone in 360\u00b0 I dropped my quite a few times but the case protected it quite qood. This is excellent product for the price",

Also I read many reviews about the cons of this cover. I couldn't find any. Don't expect a 1+ quality sandstone finish, still this rough rubbery texture makes sure the phone won't slip. And IT DOES NOT SCRATCH TGR PHONE OR LEAD TO THE SLIVER PAINT COMING OFF. Its fantastic.",
