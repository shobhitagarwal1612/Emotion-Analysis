Gaming is very smooth and you can easily play high graphic game with no frame drops.\n-display is very crisp and screen size is big enough for movies and games.\n-dolby atmos enhances sound quality and is perfect for listening songs.\n-built quility is awesome.it looks very premium and equally durable. Gorilla glass is very much durable and scratch free. \n-finger print sensor is perfect.\n-ir blaster works well.(not very useful feature)\n-its eui os is nice but little different from others..you can download Google launcher instead for better experience of ui\n\nCons\n-again camera in low light \n-battery backup (heavy users).\n-3.5 audio jack is missing.\n.....\nBottom line:its pros makes this phone better than redmi note 3 and even note 4."
